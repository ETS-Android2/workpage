Workpage is a simple productivity manager. It allows you to note any task that you have to do or any idea, helping you to free your mind.

Workpage is open source software. It does not have any advertisement and will never have.

Features:
---------
1. Contexts: Tasks are groupped by "contexts", helping you to focus on one context (e.g. "Personal", "Work"...).
2. Tags: They allow you to classify and filter the tasks of a particular context.
3. Colors: You can asily associate a task with one or more tags using colors.
4. Flexible dates/times: No Date, Single Date or Date Range.
5. Dates/times are shown in the system timezone: If you change the system timezone, dates/times will be automatically adapted.
6. Reminders: Every task can optionally have reminders.
7. Data export/import: You can make a backup of your data into a file and recover it later, in your device or in another.
8. Available languages: English and Spanish.
