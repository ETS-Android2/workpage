Workpage is a simple productivity manager. It allows you to note any task that you have to do or any idea, helping you to free your mind.

Workpage is open source software. It does not have any advertisement and will never have.

Features:
---------
1. Contexts: Tasks are groupped by "contexts", helping you to focus on one context (e.g. "Personal", "Work"...).
2. Tags: They allow you to classify and filter the tasks of a particular context.
3. Colors: You can asily associate a task with one or more tags using colors.
4. Different dates/time modes: No Date, Single Date and Date Range.
5. Time zone support: You can set specific time zones for each task. For a single task, you can set the start date with a specific time zone and the end date with another time zone.
6. Reminders: Every task can optionally have reminders.
7. Data export/import: You can make a backup of your data into a file and recover it later, in your device or in another.
8. Available languages: English, Spanish and German.
